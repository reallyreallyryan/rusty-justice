## 🎨 Visual Style & Future Enhancements

### Current Aesthetic
- Cyber-western terminal theme
- Green matrix colors (#00ff41)
- Retro monospace fonts (Courier New)
- Functional button-based UI

### Sprite Implementation Roadmap
To upgrade to professional card game visuals:

1. **Card Sprites**: Create 44 individual card images with cyber-western designs
2. **Animation System**: Card dealing, flipping, and effect animations  
3. **Table Layout**: Green felt background with defined card areas
4. **UI Polish**: Replace text buttons with styled graphics
5. **Boss Themes**: Unique visual styles per boss encounter

**Technical Approach for Sprites:**
```javascript
// Load card assets
this.load.image('card_5_gear', 'assets/cards/card_5_gear.png');

// Create card sprite instead of text
const cardSprite = this.add.image(x, y, 'card_5_gear');
cardSprite.setScale(0.8);

// Add animations
this.tweens.add({
    targets: cardSprite,
    x: finalX,
    y: finalY,
    duration: 500,
    ease: 'Power2'
});
```
